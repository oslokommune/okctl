# Release 0.0.14

This release makes it more fun to deploy applications

## Features
* Adds a `okctl create application` command for scaffolding a declaration file which can be used to scaffold an application
* Adds a `okctl apply application` command which will, based on the declaration file, scaffold the kubernetes and argocd
resource files needed to deploy an application

## Bugfixes
- `okctl venv` didn't support environment variables that contained equals sign, such as "MYVAR=a=b". This is now fixed.
