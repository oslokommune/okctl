The focus now is on setting up the kubernetes cluster itself, which primarily revolves around integrating the cluster more with AWS services.

- Verify the cloud formation templates using localstack (only partially successful)

- Installed [alb-ingress-controller](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller)
- Added a `okctl version` command
