# Release 0.0.27

## Features

### Declarrative cluster!

By using the following commands, one can now create a cluster using a declaration rather than the wizard.

`okctl scaffold cluster` scaffolds a cluster declaration

`okctl apply cluster` applies a cluster declaration that defines what parts of the cluster should exist

For now, only resources that don't require a certificate will be created.
