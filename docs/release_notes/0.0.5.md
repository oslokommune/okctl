# Release 0.0.5

This is the first stable release of the cluster create and delete actions! ðŸŽ‰ While there aren't many shiny new visible changes, the internal rewrite has been substantial. A lot of effort has gone into getting this release out and preparing for speed. After the implementation of something closer to the CLEAN architecture and a domain model approach, we should be able to add new features a lot more easily, without being afraid of breaking too many things along the way.

## Features

- We now write a log to a file under $HOME/.okctl/logs
- Rewrote the CLI to a client/server model, the CLI now only sends requests to the server. This decouples these components, which can introduce some fragility, but it also means that it is easier to move the server part out if required.
- Increased test coverage by 30% or so, we are at around 50%, which is ok, but we are aiming for around 70%
