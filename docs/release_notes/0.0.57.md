KM255: Fix certificate created in any case during apply application

KM256: Fixed that it was not possible to deploy more than once to ArgoCD (#507). If you encounter problems with this,
that is, if you have used `okctl apply application` between 0.0.54 and 0.0.56, you can do the following steps to fix
the problem:

```shell
cd my-okctl-iac-repo
okctl apply application -f my-application.yaml
git add . && git commit -m "Fix application" && git push
```

When pushed, ArgoCD should automatically deploy your application.
