# Release 0.0.49

In this release we have a new feature that might interest many, we now provide the ability to create an [AWS RDS Postgres](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/) from the declared cluster:

One simply has to add the following section to the scaffolded `cluster.yaml` file:

```yaml
metadata:
  environment: test
databases:
  postgres:
    - name: dbtest
      user: administrator
      namespace: dbtest
```

Followed by applying the updated declaration with:

```bash
$ okctl apply cluster -f cluster.yaml
```

One can then use the new `attach` command to connect to the database with `psql`:

```bash
$ okctl attach postgres --environment test --name dbtest
```

When we create the database we also set up:

- Secrets manager secret for the administrator password
- Rotation of the password every 30 days
- A security group that allows connectivity to RDS Postgres
- Create an ExternalSecret and ConfigMap in the namespace that make available the required information
