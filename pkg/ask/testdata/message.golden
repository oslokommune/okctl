	We have created a domain for you at: test.oslo.systems

	For this domain to resolve we need to delegate an
	AWS HostedZone to your account, to do this we need
	that you send us the domain and NS records that we
	have printed below to one of these places:

		- Slack: #kjøremiljø-support on slack
		- Email: okctl@oslo.kommune.no

	Hi!
