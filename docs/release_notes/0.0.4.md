# Release 0.0.4

It is now possible to create and delete a [AWS EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/clusters.html) cluster using okctl. The functionality isn't stable, which means that you might get surprising error messages. Primarily, this is due to a lock of testing, which is why testing will be a focus in the next few releases. This includes nightly integration tests to verify that things still work. 

## Features

- Implemented a wrapper around the `eksctl` cli
- Provide ability to delete an EKS cluster and VPC
- Provide ability to create an EKS cluster and VPC
- Added outputs to the VPC cloud formation template; we use these outputs when creating the EKS cluster with eksctl

## Fixes

- Resolved all static analysis issues
- Turned on more aggressive go linting and resolved all issues

## Other

- We now use https://codecov.io/ to get some insights into how we are doing with our test code coverage
- Integrated with https://sonarcloud.io/ to get static analysis of the code for revealing security issues, etc.
