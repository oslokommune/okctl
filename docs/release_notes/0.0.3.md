# Release 0.0.3

With this release the focus is on getting an EKS compatible VPC up and running. We have also rewritten and restructured parts of the internal code to ensure faster progress in the future.

## Features

- Validate a CIDR block to see if it is in a legal range, and has a sufficient address space
- From a CIDR block we create and distribute subnets across public, private and database subnets and availability zones
- Generate a cloud formation template for creating a VPC
- Create a cloud formation stack on AWS from a provided cloud formation template
- When no configuration for okctl or a repository exists, we offer a guided configuration process

## Bug fixes

- We now use the provided MFA token when logging into AWS
