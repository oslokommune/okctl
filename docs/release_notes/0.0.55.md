# Release 0.0.55

Great googily moogily, finally a new release! While it might have taken some time, we think it was worth the wait. We have rewritten large parts of okctl, primarily related to how we store state and how we create and delete resources. In combination, these changes should lead to a more stable experience. It also means that less breaking changes should occur. From now on we will have a focus on seamless upgrades.

**NB**: There might still be some inconsistencies in the documentation

## Features
✅ Add OKCTL_DECLARATION env var as a substitute to --cluster-declaration
