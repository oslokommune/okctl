# Release 0.0.53

If you want to attach to the database from your IDE, you can do so now by setting up a port forwarder with the following command:

```bash
# uuidgen > my-password-file
# okctl forward postgres --environment test --name dbtest --username bob --password-file my-password-file
```

By default, this will forward traffic to the postgres port of `5432`, but you can change this to what you want with `--listen-port xxx`.
