# Release 0.0.2

We now offer some actual options to interact with the CLI, where the first set of functionality is to configure the CLI itself and run a login command, which will authenticate and authorize with AWS.

## Features

- The CLI no longer fails silently, but actually provides some useful feedback
- Configuration of the user will be stored in `$HOME/.okctl/`

## Other

Configuration of a repository must still be done manually, for testing you can create a `.okctl.yml` file in any directory and add the following content:

```yaml
name: okctl
region: eu-west-1
baseDir: deployment/
clusters:
  - name: pro
    aws:
      account: 000000000000 # Replace with a valid AWS account number, 12 digits
      profile: aws-okctl-pro
```

Only the AWS account number needs to be set.
