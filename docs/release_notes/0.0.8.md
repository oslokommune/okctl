# Release 0.0.8

Sometimes it can be useful to setup a minimal cluster for testing or experimentation, which doesn't consume large amounts of resources. With `okctl` we provide such functionality through the `testcluster` command. The `testcluster` reduces overhead by omitting a number of integrations. This means that we don't integrate with Github or setup Argo CD.

The `testcluster` command also uses the smaller `t2.medium` instances when creating a [NodeGroup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/launch-workers.html). In addition, we only configure one [NAT Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) for all the private subnets, which means we reduce the number of [EIPs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) we need.
