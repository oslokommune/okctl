# For help finding values, see https://okctl.io/getting-started/create-cluster
metadata:
  # Account ID is your AWS account ID
  accountID: '123456789012'
  # Environment is the name you use to identify the type of cluster it is. Common names are production, test, staging
  environment: production
  # Name can be anything, but should define the scope of the cluster. Meaning if the cluster is scoped to one product,
  # you might want to name it the name of the product. If the cluster contains all services and products owned by a
  # team, the team name might be more fitting.
  name: someclustername
  # Region defines the AWS region to prefer when creating resources
  # region: eu-west-1

# The cluster root URL defines the domain of which to create services beneath. For example; okctl will setup ArgoCD
# which has a frontend. The frontend will be available at https://argocd.<clusterRootURL>. For Cognito it will be 
# https://auth.<clusterRootURL>
clusterRootURL: someclustername-production.oslo.systems

# For okctl to be able to setup ArgoCD correctly for you, it needs to know what repository on Github that will contain
# your infrastructure.
github:
  # The name of the repository
  repository: my_repo
  # The organization that owns the repository
  # organisation: oslokommune
  # The folder to place infrastructure declarations
  # outputPath: my_infrastructure

  # ArgoCD is a service that watches a repository for Kubernetes charts and ensures the defined resources are running
  # as declared in the cluster

  # Autoscaler automatically adjusts the size of pods and nodes in your cluster depending on load

  # AWS Load Balancer Controller handles routing from the internet to your application running inside your okctl
  # Kubernetes cluster. If you want your applications and services accessible from the internet, this needs to be
  # enabled.

  # Cognito is an authentication provider that okctl uses to control access to different resources, like ArgoCD and
  # Grafana

## okctl creates a Virtual Private Cloud for you which it organizes all the intended resources that require networking.
## A VPC is mandatory, but can be configured by the following attributes.
#vpc:
#  # CIDR defines the VPC IP range. Leave this be if you don't know what it is/does
#  cidr: 192.168.0.0/20
#  highAvailability: true
