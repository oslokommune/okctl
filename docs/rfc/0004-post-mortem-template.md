-->
Date: 21.12.2021

## Context
<!--
    Short description of why this decision is needed

    Example:
    We want to better document our decisions
-->
We want to streamline the post-mortem process to improve speed and quality of post-mortem productions.

## Decision
<!--
    Short summary of the decision

    Example:
    We've decided to go for AlphaGov's system as explained [here](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws/blob/24d1ea513e58ee938043d71d09815a51229067bf/docs/architecture/decisions/0001-record-architecture-decisions.md)
-->
We've decided to go for [this](/docs/post-mortems/0000-post-mortem-template.md) template.

All post-mortems are to be placed in [/docs/post-mortems](/docs/post-mortems).

The post-mortem template is a guideline. Add and/or remove points you deem reasonable.

## Consequences
<!--
    Short description of positive and negative consequences of the decision

    Example:
    The decisions we deem relevant will be documented in this format here in this folder.
-->

### Pros

- By placing the post-mortems in a folder in a public repository, we will:
  - lead by example as an openness focused team.
  - share our hard-earned knowledge with others.
  - inspire others to both share and implement the post-mortem process.
- Define the process to establish it for faster and better post-mortem productions.

### Cons

- Difficulties can arise when formulating post-mortems that are to be publicly viewed.
- Harder to cooperate on a single document than for example Google Docs. (can be mitigated with pair/mob writing)
