# Release 0.0.7

The focus now is on setting up the kubernetes cluster itself, which primarily revolves around integrating the cluster more with AWS services. The major feature of this release is the addition
of ArgoCD with a UI URL that uses Github for authorisation.

The delete functionality is not complete, which means there is some manual clean-up required, e.g., need to delete the `argocd` namespace manually, etc., to take down the ALBs prior to running the `delete cluster` command.

## Features

- Implemented functionality for creating a Kubernetes cluster for integration tests using [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d)
- Create an AWS compatible mock container using [localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack)
- Wrote a Helm client for bootstrapping some components from outside the cluster
- Verify the cloud formation templates using localstack (only partially successful)
- Added support for [keyring](https://github.com/99designs/keyring), so developers can save their password
- Installed [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns)
- Installed [external-secrets](https://github.com/godaddy/kubernetes-external-secrets)
- Installed [alb-ingress-controller](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller)
- Installed [argocd](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/)
- Added a `okctl version` command
- Added a [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) runner, which uses Helm as a library
- Added a [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) runner, which uses various k8s modules
- Added ability to create a delegated route53 hosted zone
- Refactored major parts of the CLI, among others moving all the filesystem writes to clientside
- Provide better feedback to the developer while the tasks are running
- Configure a infrastructure as code (IAC) repo for use with ArgoCD by adding a deploy key (read-only)
- Create an oauth app for authentication towards Github
- Create a primary hostedzone and integrate with external dns
- Create ACM certificates

## Usability

- Created an interview guided and planned sessions with developers to gather insights and requirements
- Planned testing sessions with developeres to determine the CLIs usability
