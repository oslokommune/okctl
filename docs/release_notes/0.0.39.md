# Release 0.0.39

Primary new feature is that we export all cloud formation outputs. Please be aware that this requires you remove any references to these exports before running delete with okctl:

> After another stack imports an output value, you can't delete the stack that is exporting the output value or modify the exported output value. All of the imports must be removed before you can delete the exporting stack or modify the output value.

## Features
- Export all outputs, so they can be referenced by other cloud formation stacks
- Add an output to the VPC stack for the DBSubnetGroupName

- Allow for AWS service user authentication through environment variables
