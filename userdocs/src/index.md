# `okctl` - Opinionated and effortless infrastructure and application management

`okctl` is a CLI for creating a production environment on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) using [Elastic Kubernetes Service](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) (EKS) as its foundation, we aim to be:

    <img src="img/logo.png" alt="Okctl logo">
</div>

<!-- <span style="display:block;text-align:center">![okctl](img/logo.png)</span> -->

- **Specialised**: by tightly integrating with the services provided by Oslo kommune
- **Highly opinionated**: you will get something that works well that may not be exactly what you want
- **Modern**: base our decisions on best-practise methodologies for a modern development lifecycle
- **Sensible**: provide a set of sensible default integrations

</div>

## Compare and contrast

With `okctl` we are attempting to solve the production environment setup problem. What we include within the definition of a production environment, we can see below.

| Functionality | okctl | [eksctl](https://eksctl.io) | [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) | [serverless.tf](https://serverless.tf) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Provide authentication and authorisation|✓||?||
|Define a continuous integration pipeline|?||||
|Assist with creating a deployment pipeline|✓|✓|||
|Create a Kubernetes cluster (run-time environment)|✓|✓|||
|Facilitate with application setup and integration|✓||✓|✓|
|Provide integrations with version control system|✓||||
|Setup monitoring with metrics, logs and traces|✓||||

## Roadmap

We have a cluster up and running, and we are currently working on building a seamless experience on top of this cluster with integrations for common functionality:

### Core cluster

- [x] [ExternalSecrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/kubernetes-external-secrets/) for storing secrets securely
- [x] [AWS ALB Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-alb-ingress-controller) creates load balancers for incoming traffic
- [x] [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) ensures humane DNS hostnames 
- [x] [Autoscaler](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/) for adjusting the size of pods and nodes
- [x] [Argo CD](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd) gives us continuous delivery
- [x] [Kubernetes Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus) for monitoring
- [x] [Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) CSI driver](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver/) for block storage
- [x] [Loki](https://github.com/grafana/loki) for consuming logs
- [x] [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) for processing traces

### Application lifecycle

- [ ] [Postgres](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/) for creating and integrating a postgres database with your application
- [ ] [Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) for creating and assisting with the publication of container images for use in the cluster
