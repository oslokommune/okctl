# Release 0.0.5

This is the first stable release of the cluster create and delete actions. Therefore there is little new functionality, but most parts have been refactored and test coverage has increased.

## Features

- We now write a log to a file under $HOME/.okctl/logs

## Fixes

- Rewrote the CLI to a client/server model, the CLI now only sends requests to the server. This decouples these components, which can introduce some fragility, but it also means that it is easier to move the server part out if required.
- Increased test coverage by 30% or so, we are slightly above 50%, which is pretty good, our aim is for around 70%
