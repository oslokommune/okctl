# Release 0.0.4

It is now possible to create an [AWS EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/clusters.html) cluster.

## Features

- Implemented a wrapper around the `eksctl` cli so we can create the EKS cluster
- Added outputs to the VPC cloud formation template; these outputs are needed for creating the EKS cluster

## Other

- We now use https://codecov.io/ to get some insights into how we are doing with our test code coverage
- Integrated with https://sonarcloud.io/ to get static analysis of the code for revealing security issues, etc.
