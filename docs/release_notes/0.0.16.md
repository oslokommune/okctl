# Release 0.0.16

## Features
- OKCTL_PS1 can now refer to `%env` which will be replaced with okctl environment. This is useful if you want to get
the part of "myenv:mynamespace" in your custom OKCTL_PS1.

## Bugfixes
- Setting OKCTL_PS1 in `okctl venv` didn't work properly because of missing quotes in the resulting subshell's PS1. This
is now fixed.
