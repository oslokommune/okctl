# Release 0.0.6

With this release we are adding compute resources to the cluster in form of a [Fargate profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate-profile.html), which allows us to schedule resources in the `kube-system` and `default` namespace onto ECS/Fargate. We also add an unmanaged node group, which prepares for pods that require functionality not made available by ECS/Fargate, since ECS/Fargate has some [restrictions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/fargate.html).

## Features

- Added a Fargate profile to the `kube-system` and `default` namespaces
- Created an unmanaged node group
- Write a kubeconfig to `~/.okctl/credentials/[cluster-env]/kubeconfig`
- Write aws credentials and config to `~/.okctl/credentials/[cluster-env]/{aws-config, aws-credentials}`
- Added command for dumping the credentials as envvars, e.g, `okctl show credentials [environment]`

## Fixes

- Private subnet should not map up public IP-addresses

## Other

- Created Github PR and Issue templates
- Added more static security analysis with Github's CodeQL
- Removed the `storage/state` package, because it was horrible
- Removed the unused control plane security group
- The logs to stdout were too verbose, so structs are now only available with `OKCTL_DEBUG=true`, though they are still always written to `~.okctl/logs/*`
