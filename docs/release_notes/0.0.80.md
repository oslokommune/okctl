# Release 0.0.80

NB: Manual steps required!

This upgrade moves the local `state.db` file to a remote location (Amazon S3). This is to better control and synchronize
changes across different users.

Due to upgrade requiring state during an upgrade, we'll need to do this upgrade outside the upgrade process.

To upgrade:

1. Run `okctl maintenance state-upload <path to state.db>` to move the state.db file to a remote location.
   The `state.db`
   usually resides in `<iac root>/infrastructure/<cluster name>/state.db`
2. Delete the relevant `state.db` file, commit and push the changes.

You might want to run `okctl venv -c <cluster.yaml>` first to ensure valid authentication.
